 MPLS VPN DEPLOYMENT: BGP over OSPF with LibreNMS Integration
Executive Summary
This project simulates a complex Service Provider core network architecture using BGP over an OSPF backbone with MPLS for traffic forwarding. This demonstrates expertise in carrier-grade routing, traffic engineering, and essential Network Operations (NetOps) functions via Network Monitoring System (NMS) integration.

1. Network Architecture and Protocol Layering
The design employs a three-tiered protocol architecture to provide secure, scalable service:

Protocol

Role

Skill Demonstrated

OSPF

Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). Used to distribute the loopback addresses of the Provider Edge (PE) routers across the backbone.

Mastery of link-state routing and stable core routing.

MPLS (LDP)

Data Plane. Provides the Label Switched Path (LSP) across the core network, ensuring high-speed label-based traffic forwarding.

Expertise in traffic engineering and LDP configuration.

BGP

Control Plane. Distributes customer networks between the PE routers.

Advanced knowledge of BGP route reflectors and multiprotocol extensions.

2. Key Technical Implementation Details
BGP Configuration: Implemented iBGP configuration between R1 and R3 and eBGP between Customer Edge (CE) and PE routers. The setup integrates OSPF for interface connectivity and uses MPLS for traffic distribution via label switching, effectively limiting traditional IGP routing table (FIB) lookups for fast packet distribution.

3. Network Operations (NetOps) and Monitoring
The network was integrated with a simulated LibreNMS server to demonstrate operational readiness and NetOps practices.

Integration: A dedicated device was configured to connect to the NMS via the GNS3 Cloud device to simulate real-world monitoring.

Security: Devices were configured with SNMPv2c/v3 and restricted via ACLs to ensure only the LibreNMS server could securely poll network metrics.

🛡️ Device and Network Security Hardening
To demonstrate a holistic approach to network management, this repository also includes a dedicated lab focused on implementing strict security controls at both the switch and firewall layers.

Key Security Implementations:
ASA Firewall ACLs: Configured multiple Access Control Lists (ACLs) to strictly control traffic for critical services (TACACS+, Mail, Web) into defined security zones, enforcing the principle of least privilege.

Switch Hardening: Implemented essential Layer 2 security features to mitigate common threats:

Port Security: Limiting MAC addresses and using sticky MAC to prevent unauthorized devices.

STP Defense: BPDU Guard and PortFast to mitigate Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) manipulation.

Storm Control: Preventing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks from broadcast storms.

802.1x: Enabled port-based authentication to manage device access control.

Reliable Timing: Configured NTP (Network Time Protocol) for reliable time synchronization across all devices—critical for accurate log correlation during security events.

(All configuration files for these security features are stored in the dedicated sub-folder: Security_Hardening_Lab/)
